            It had 23 towers and 6 arched gates.

   </p>
   <p class="f2">
    During the enemy's invasion, the entire population of the villages that were building the fortress-wall took refuge here with their livelihood. They were in charge of guarding the towers and walls. The walls of the castle are two-tiered, the thickness of the wall of the lower tier is 1.5 meters, the thickness of the upper tier is 70-80 cm. The difference in the thickness of these walls creates a battle path from the inside, the width of which was sufficient for the movement of fighters. Stone steps were arranged on the sides of the towers and several other places in the fort to climb the path. Most of the towers had a two-story battle room. A church named after St. Stephen is built into the fortress wall.

            Church of St. George of Sighnaghi is located in the city
             of Sighnaghi in Kakheti. It dates back to the 19th century.
              The church is a hall-type building, although its outer masses
               are divided in such a way that it gives the impression of 
               a three-nave church.
